# GifTastic
Please begin using this app by clicking on a button and seeeing what it does. Then add something new to the search field and click the button that has been created.


This application was created to show how to pull from an API, making a call to the api and having it response. Using that response when you click on a button, the button would go to the api and pull the search material for that button, and then show it on the screen. It also showed us how to use an input field so that we could provide users of the app a way to add more buttons and search in that way. The final test was that gif provids moving gif so on click of the image we can stop and reset it the image back to still.

This app was very fun to make.
